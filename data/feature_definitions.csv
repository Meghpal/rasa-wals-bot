Feature_Name,,, Feature_Definition
Asymmetrical Case-Marking,,, Morphological case inflection is an efficient strategy for encoding syntactic relationships. Therefore one might naively expect that case-marking languages should use it consistently, by applying the same case categories to all nominal expressions occurring in the appropriate syntactic positions. Indeed, there are many case-marking languages of this kind. Such languages exhibiting identical sets of case categories for all nominals are called case symmetrical. Other languages, however, apply case marking more selectively across their lexicon, restricting the occurrence of certain (or all) cases to a subset of their nominals. The different subsets of nominals therefore display different case inventories. This typological property of languages is called case asymmetry, and the languages themselves, case asymmetrical. 
Irregular Negatives in Sign Languages,,, The term irregular negative refers to several types of forms that will be called negative suppletion and negative derivation here. They all have in common that they express negation in a non-standard way. The canonical marking of negation in sign languages involves, on the one hand, negative particles that are independent signs and, on the other hand, non-manual negative signals (head movements and facial expressions) that co-occur with the negated signs. Neither the negative particles nor the non-manual negative signals affect the form of the sign or signs being negated. In example (1), from Indo-Pakistani Sign Language, there is a clause-final negative particle, and the non-manual negative signal is a headshake (indicated by the line labelled “neg” on top of the sign glosses). The negated predicate ‘interesting’ takes the same form as it would in a positive clause.
Presence of Uncommon Consonants,,, In this chapter the worldwide pattern of occurrence of four rather unusual classes of consonants will be discussed. These four classes are clicks, labial-velar plosives, pharyngeals, and dental or alveolar non-sibilant fricatives. This last class includes sounds similar to those represented by the th in English words such as this or thing; for brevity they will often be referred to as “th” sounds in the text. Each of these classes of consonants occurs in relatively few languages, but they exemplify different patterns of geographical distribution, some being concentrated in particular areas while others are dispersed. The occurrence of these consonants in the consonant inventory as discussed in Chapter 1 was examined in a sample of 566 languages. Since each of the four types of consonants being discussed is relatively rare, the great majority (448, or 79.2%) of the languages do not have any of them. However, viewing the world on a large scale, at least one of these special kinds of consonants tends to be found in at least some language in all major areas.
Glottalized Consonants,,, In this chapter the distribution of consonants whose production involves certain special actions of the larynx will be discussed. In the great majority of consonant sounds, the vocal folds inside the larynx are either open so that air from the lungs can freely flow into the mouth, or they are brought close together so that air flowing between them causes them to vibrate, producing the effect called voicing (as discussed in Chapters 1, 4 and 5). All languages have some sounds which are voiceless, that is, are produced with open vocal folds, and some which are voiced. In addition to these two settings there are other, less commonly used adjustments of the larynx involving either a tighter constriction of the vocal folds and/or a movement of the larynx a short distance up or down in the throat. Consonants with these characteristics are known as glottalized (from the word glottis, the name given to the space between the vocal folds).
Pronominal and Adnominal Demonstratives,,, Demonstratives are commonly divided into pronominal demonstratives, which substitute for a noun (phrase), and adnominal demonstratives, which accompany a coreferential noun. In English, pronominal and adnominal demonstratives have the same forms: this  and that  may function as independent pronouns, as in (1a), or they may cooccur with a noun, as in (1b).
Number of Basic Colour Categories,,, These are the two pairs of fundamental opponent chromatic colours <Red, Green> and <Yellow, Blue> and the single pair of fundamental achromatic colours <Black, White>. Black and white are not opposed in the same sense as the chromatic pairs. For example, we can see a combination of black and white (gray) but there is no sensation consisting of the combination of red and green or of blue and yellow. (That blue and yellow pigments can be mixed to produce a green pigment is not relevant; there are no bluish yellow or yellowish blue sensations.)
Suppletion According to Tense and Aspect,,, The maps in this and the following chapter show the distribution of suppletion in verb paradigms according to tense-aspect, imperative and hortative moods, and verbal number. Suppletion is defined as the phenomenon whereby regular semantic relations are encoded by unpredictable formal patterns. Cases where the paradigmatically related forms share some phonological material are examples of weak suppletion, as in English buy vs. bought, while cases with no shared phonological material are instances of strong suppletion, as in English go vs. went (Dressler 1985). These types reflect two ends of a continuum rather than an either-or opposition. Mel’čuk (1994) also introduces the criterion of uniqueness, i.e. in order to be classified as suppletive, the alternation shown between two paradigmatically related forms should be unique, in that no other two forms in the language show exactly the same morphophonological alternation, as in Spanish digo ‘say.pres.1.sg’ vs. dije ‘say.pret.1.sg’. The maps concentrate on strong and unique cases.
Suppletion in Imperatives and Hortatives,,, Nothing found on this topic!
Genitives, Adjectives and Relative Clauses,,, In English, as evident in (1), these three semantic functions are coded by means of three different morphosyntactic constructions: in (1a) the attributive expression precedes the head and is marked with the possessive enclitic 's, in (1b) the attributive expression precedes the head but is unmarked, and in (1c) the attributive expression follows the head and is marked with the complementizer that. Based on paradigms such as the above in English and in other languages, grammarians distinguish between three different types of constructions, genitives, adjectives and relative clauses, of which the above are typical examples.
Vowel Nasalization,,, This chapter deals with the distribution of contrastive vowel nasalization in the world’s languages. The existence of contrastive nasal vowels is well known in some languages, e.g. French /pɛ̃/ pain ‘bread’ vs. /pɛ/ paix ‘peace’. About a quarter of the languages in our sample have a nasal–oral vowel contrast.
Nasal Vowels in West Africa,,, Map 10B shows the complexity of nasal vowel systems in West Africa, an area already identified as having a high density of such systems. It distinguishes among languages that have no nasal vs. oral contrast, those with only a two-way oral vs. nasal contrast, and those that have larger four-way systems incorporating vowel length. It also indicates which languages also have some kind of nasal spreading across segments. 
Verbal Number and Suppletion,,, This chapter shows the distribution of suppletion according to verbal number. The term verbal number requires some clarification: number as a verbal category can reflect the number of times an action is done or the number of participants in the action. When we say that a verb or verb phrase in an Indo-European language, say French, is in the plural, as in ils étaient fatigués  ('they were tired'), what we mean is that the verb phrase étaient fatigués  agrees with the subject ils  in number. The term plural verbs (or pluractional verbs) in many of the languages to be discussed below, on the other hand, refers to any or all of the following senses: the action is performed several times (iterative), or at several places (distributive), or the action affects or involves several participants. For example, Mupun (West Chadic; Nigeria) uses derivational means such as infixation in (1a), suffixation in (1b) or completely different verbs in (1c) to express plural action or plural participants.
Purpose Clauses,,, This chapter investigates the form of the verb in purpose clauses. Following a common practice in typological research (see among others Stassen 1985 and Croft 1990: ch.1), purpose clauses are defined in functional rather than morphosyntactic terms, as the latter turn out to be of restricted applicability in cross-linguistic comparison. A purpose construction is regarded as one encoding a particular relation between events. This relation is such that one of the linked events (the one coded by the main clause, or the main event) is performed with the goal of obtaining the realization of another one (the one coded by the purpose clause, or the dependent event). Typical cases of purpose relations involve motion predicates in the main event, as in (1). In this case, main and dependent event share a participant. However, non-motion predicates may also be involved, in which case main and dependent event need not share a participant, as is shown by (2)
Obligatory Possessive Inflection,,, In many languages with head-marked possession (see Chapter 24) some nouns obligatorily require possessive inflection and cannot be used alone. For example, the nouns illustrated in (1) and (2) from Navajo (Athabaskan; New Mexico and Arizona) and Acoma (Keresan; New Mexico) cannot stand alone and require possessive inflection.
Number of Possessive Nouns,,, The typological antithesis to obligatorily possessed nouns is nouns that cannot take the head-marked possessive inflection available in the language. There are a number of languages with such non-possessible nouns in our sample, and most of these languages have nouns conventionalized or grammatically specialized for use in apposition to the possessed noun and bearing the inflectional possessive marking which the head noun cannot bear. For instance, in Guaraní (Tupi-Guarani; Paraguay), various nouns including animal names cannot take the usual head-marked possessive inflection. In the event that possession needs to be expressed for such a noun one or another abstract or generic noun is put in apposition to the semantically possessed non-possessible, and that abstract or generic noun is inflected for possession
Fixed Stress Locations,,, This and the next three Chapters (15, 16, 17) report on word stress and word rhythm in the world's languages. The data were collected for a project called StressTyp and are also available on-line (see Goedemans and van der Hulst, forthcoming). The StressTyp database contains 510 languages, based on written primary and secondary sources (such as grammars and typological studies). StressTyp naturally only documents languages that have stress and therefore does not provide data about the numerous languages that are reported to lack stress, often tonal languages. In these chapters, ancient or extinct languages are excluded in accordance with the general policy of this atlas, so that the maps are based on a sample of 500 languages.
Distributive Numerals,,, Most languages have a series of cardinal numerals such as English one, two, three, and so on. Some of the ways in which such numerals are formed are described in Chapter 131. In addition, most languages also have various other series of numerals, whose forms are derived from cardinal numerals, and whose denotations combine the concept of number with other concepts of a variety of different kinds. Perhaps the most well-known of these other series are the ordinal numerals, described in Chapter 53. This map is concerned with one of the many other kinds of numeral series, namely, distributive numerals.
Perfective/Imperfective Aspect,,, The distinction between imperfective and perfective plays an important role in many verb systems and is commonly signalled by morphological means (rather than being expressed periphrastically). A particularly straightforward case is found in Rendille (East Cushitic; Kenya). Nonstative verbs in Rendille distinguish two basic forms, one which normally ends in -a  and one which normally ends in -e, as illustrated by the examples in (1).
Plurality in Independent Personal Pronouns,,, Somewhat paradoxically, the plural of personal pronouns has been considered both as a core phenomenon of nominal number and as something that has nothing to do with it. On the one hand, several scholars have suggested that if a language has a number distinction anywhere, then it has it at least in pronouns, or, speaking in diachronic terms, that plurality has spread from plural personal pronouns to other nominals (cf. Forchheimer 1953). On the other hand, linguists have repeatedly argued that pronominal plurals are different from nominal plurals in that the two have a different reference structure. Thus, it is observed that ‘we’ is not the same as ‘I + I + … I’ (e.g. Benveniste 1966a, Barulin 1980; cf. also Corbett 2000: 83-84). This chapter provides an account of what types of formal correlations between plurals and singulars are actually observed in personal pronouns, and how the devices for expressing pronominal plurality relate to the devices for expressing nominal plurality. It is based on 260 languages, including the 200 languages of the WALS sample, and will thus contribute further empirical data to the discussion. 
Systems of Gender Assignment,,, In Chapters 30 and 31 we have seen how we as linguists analyze gender systems, and establish how many genders there are. The remaining question is how the speaker assigns nouns to those genders. In other words, if a speaker of Russian uses the word kniga  ‘book’ or djadja  ‘uncle’, how does he or she "know" the gender? Clearly speakers must know the gender in order to be able to make the appropriate agreements. A model of the way in which speakers allot nouns to genders is called a gender assignment system.
Coding of Nominal Plurality,,, This map shows the method by which a language indicates plurality with nouns. There are basically two ways in which languages indicate plurality. The first (and most common) involves changing the morphological form of the noun, as in English dog, dogs. The second involves indicating plurality by means of a morpheme that occurs somewhere else in the noun phrase, illustrated by the plural word in the example in (1) from Hawaiian, where the word mau  has the same function as the plural suffix in English, but is a separate word modifying the noun.
Order of Subject, Object and Verb,,, The terms subject  and object  are used here in a rather informal semantic sense, to denote the more agent-like and more patient-like elements respectively. Their use here can be defined in terms of the notions S, A, and P, where the S is the single argument in an intransitive clause, the A is the more agent-like argument in a transitive clause, and the P is the more patient-like argument in a transitive clause. For the purposes of this map, then, the term subject  is used for the A while the term object  is used for the P. A language shown on the map as SOV could thus also be equally well and perhaps more accurately described as APV. Note that many linguists use the terms subject  and object  somewhat differently from this, and some linguists question the applicability of these terms to some languages, but these issues do not arise with the use of these terms here. For example, there is controversy surrounding the question of what ought to be considered the subject in Philippine languages, like Cebuano (cf. Schachter 1976). Cebuano has two common ways to express transitive clauses, one of which is illustrated in (3).
Languages with two Dominant Orders of Subject, Object, and Verb,,, Type 2 represents languages which are SVO/VSO. The fact that there are half as many languages of this type compared to SOV/SVO languages while there are more than five times as many SOV as VSO languages means that the ratio of SVO/VSO to VSO is higher than the ratio of SOV/SVO to SOV. In other words, the frequency of Type 2 is greater than we might expect. The high number of Type 2 languages relates to Universal 6 of Greenberg (1963): “All languages with dominant VSO order have SVO as an alternative or as the only alternative basic order”. Although there may be exceptions to Greenberg's universal, the fact that VSO languages generally allow SVO as an alternate word order makes it unsurprising that we would find many SVO/VSO languages. A number of the Type 2 languages occur in genealogical groups that also contain VSO languages, such as Berber, Semitic, and various subgroups of Austronesian.
Locus of Marking in Possessive Noun Phrases,,, Locus is a convenient one-word term for what is also known as head/dependent marking. In any kind of phrase, overt morphosyntactic marking reflecting the syntactic relations within the phrase may be located on the head of the phrase, on a non-head (i.e. on a dependent), on both, or on neither. Examples illustrating marking of various kinds in possessive noun phrases are (1)-(4) below. In possessive phrases, the possessed noun is head and the possessor is dependent.
Order of Degree Word and Adjective,,, This map shows the position of degree words with respect to the adjective that they modify. For the purposes of this map, the term adjective  should be interpreted in a purely semantic sense, as a word denoting a property, since in many languages the words in question do not form a separate word class, but are verbs or nouns. Degree words are words with meanings like ‘very’, ‘more’, or ‘a little’ that modify the adjective to indicate the degree to which the property denoted by the adjective obtains. Degree words are traditionally referred to as adverbs, though in many languages the degree words do not belong to the same word class as adverbs; even for English there is little basis for saying that degree words belong to the same word class as adverbs which modify verbs.
Inclusive/Exclusive Distinction in Independent Pronouns,,, The distinction between an inclusive and an exclusive pronoun is a commonly attested feature of linguistic structure, yet from a Eurocentric point of view this distinction is particularly exotic. For speakers of English (or any other European language), both the inclusive and the exclusive pronouns are to be translated as we. The difference between the two depends on the intended meaning. An inclusive pronoun necessarily includes reference to the addressee. For example, the Mandarin inclusive pronoun zámen means ‘we, I and you’; others can optionally be included. An exclusive pronoun, like the Mandarin pronoun wŏmen, excludes the addressee from the reference, resulting in a meaning like ‘I and some others, but not you’.
Inclusive/Exclusive Forms in Pama-Nyungan,,, The Pama-Nyungan stock covers Australia almost completely. Only in northern Australia are there languages which are not part of this stock, commonly called non-Pama-Nyungan (these languages are not included in this map). The Pama-Nyungan languages originally did not have an inclusive/exclusive opposition, although currently many Pama-Nyungan languages have developed it (Dixon 1980: 334-336). 
Distance Contrasts in Demonstratives,,, Demonstratives are deictic expressions such as English this and that. They indicate the relative distance of a referent in the speech situation vis-à-vis the deictic center. The deictic center, which is also called the origo, is roughly equivalent to the speaker’s location at the time of the utterance. When this and that are used contrastively, this denotes a referent in relative proximity to the deictic center and that denotes a referent at a greater distance:
Inclusive/Exclusive Distinction in Verbal Inflection,,, The distinction between an inclusive and an exclusive pronoun is a commonly attested feature of linguistic structure, yet from a Eurocentric point of view this distinction is particularly exotic. For speakers of English (or any other European language), both the inclusive and the exclusive pronouns are to be translated as we. The difference between the two depends on the intended meaning. An inclusive pronoun necessarily includes reference to the addressee. For example, the Mandarin inclusive pronoun zámen  means ‘we, I and you’; others can optionally be included. An exclusive pronoun, like the Mandarin pronoun wŏmen, excludes the addressee from the reference, resulting in a meaning like ‘I and some others, but not you’.
Order of Demonstrative and Noun,,, This map shows the different orders of demonstrative and noun. For the purposes of this map, a word or affix is considered a demonstrative if it satisfies at least one of two criteria: (1) it has among its uses a meaning that contrasts with some other form in terms of physical proximity to the speaker, so that there is at least a two-way contrast of proximal (near speaker) versus distal (not near speaker); or (2) the form has among its uses an indication that the hearer is intended to direct their attention towards something in the physical environment. In many and probably most languages, demonstratives are associated with both of these functions. The words this  and that  (and their plural forms these  and those ) constitute the demonstratives of English. In many languages, including English, the demonstratives can be used without a difference in form, either as modifiers of nouns, as in (1a), or pronominally (not modifying a noun), as in (1b).
Uvular Consonants,,, This chapter will discuss the distribution of one of the less common types of consonants, those with a uvular place of articulation. Consonants of this class are not as rare as those discussed in Chapter 19, but are nonetheless found in only roughly one sixth of the language surveyed. Most languages have consonants in which the back of the tongue is raised toward the velum; some also have consonants in which the back of the tongue is raised toward the point where the opening into the nasal cavity is located. These are called uvular consonants.
Negative Morphemes,,, This map shows the nature of morphemes signalling clausal negation in declarative sentences. By clausal negation is meant the simple negation of an entire clause; (1b) is the negative clause corresponding to the affirmative clause in (1a)
Relativization on Obliques,,, We distinguish five major groups of languages here. First, there are a number of languages that relativize upon obliques by employing the relative pronoun strategy, as exemplified in the Russian sentence in (1).
'When' Clauses,,, As was done for purpose clauses (Chapter 125), ‘when’ clauses are defined in functional, rather than morphosyntactic, terms. A ‘when’ construction is regarded as one encoding a temporal relation between two events, such that there is a temporal overlap between the two. The exact extent of the overlap is unspecified and subject to variation. For instance, in (1) and (2) the linked events are simultaneous, while in (3) they may or may not be simultaneous – in fact, there might be an interval of some days, or even months or years between them. The theoretical implications of this definition are discussed in Cristofaro (2003: ch. 2, 6), where a number of pragmatic criteria are provided to identify ‘when’ clauses under this definition.
Action Nominal Constructions,,, Map 62A shows the distribution across the world’s languages of constructions corresponding to the English John’s running and the enemy’s destruction of the city. These are action nominal constructions (ANCs), i.e. constructions which have an action nominal (AN, running, destruction) as their head and contain a reference to the participants in the situation designated by that AN. ANs themselves are either nouns or at least occur in typical nominal positions and show inflectional properties and/or combinability with adpositions typical of nouns. They are, however, in some reasonably productive way derived from verbs, either derivationally or inflectionally, and refer to events and/or facts, i.e. not just to actions, as the name might imply.  The issue at stake is whether words like running and destruction exist in a language at all and if so, how they combine with their arguments – such as John  (the S argument), the enemy  (the A argument) and the city  (the P argument). (See also Chapter 102 for the notions S, A and P.)

Order of Object, Oblique, and Verb,,, This map shows the dominant order of lexical object, oblique phrase and verb. An oblique phrase is a noun phrase or adpositional phrase (prepositional or postpositional) that functions as an adverbial modifier (or “adjunct”) of the verb. Of the six logically possible orders, five are attested, as illustrated in (1), where X  stands for an oblique phrase.
The Velar Nasal,,, This chapter addresses the distribution of the sound ŋ (the velar nasal) in the languages of the world. A very large number of languages make use of phonemic ŋ, while many others lack this sound. However, few of the sounds commonly found among the phonemic inventories of the world's languages exhibit a more clearly definable distribution than that exhibited by ŋ. This distribution has two unrelated aspects. One is the striking areal distribution of the presence vs. absence of phonemic ŋ among the languages of the world. The other striking aspect of phonemic ŋ is its phonotactic distribution: in many languages possessing this sound, it may not appear in all positions in the word, but rather is restricted to initial, medial, or final position, or some combination thereof. In the case of restriction of ŋ to non-initial position, this, too, has a relatively pronounced areal skewing among the world’s languages.
Zero Copula for Predicate Nominals,,, This map shows the areal distribution of zero copula encoding for predicate nominals. That is, the map indicates whether a given language is like English, in which predicate nominals always require an overt copula (see 1), or rather like Russian, in which omission of the copula is allowed for at least some constructions (see 2).
Order of Adjective and Noun,,, This map shows the distribution of the two possible orders of modifying adjective and noun.  English is an example of a language which is AdjN, with the adjective preceding the noun (as in large dogs ). Another example is Mising (Tibeto-Burman; northeast India), as in (1).
Relationship between the Order of Object and Verb and the Order of Adposition and Noun Phrase,,, One of the central activities in linguistic typology is the investigation of relationship between different typological features. Maps 95A, 96A, and 97A illustrate three sorts of relationship between typological features. If one takes two typological features with two values each, they intersect to define four possible language types. This map, Map 95A, illustrates a case where two of these types are very common and two are relatively uncommon. Map 96A illustrates a case where three of these types are very common and one is relatively uncommon. And Map 97A illustrates a case where there is no interaction between the two features, where all four types are very common. Each of these three maps shows the relationship between two features that are shown separately on other maps in this atlas.
Inflectional Synthesis of the Verb,,, Grammatical categories like tense, voice, or agreement can be expressed either by individual words or by affixes attached to some other word (or the stem of a word). If a word combines with affixes, the resulting construction is said to be synthetic; if not, it is said to be analytic. For example, in the past tense, the English verb combines with an affix expressing tense (cf. she painted, with suffix -ed ). Forms like painted  are called synthetic. In the future tense, by contrast, the verb does not combine with an affix; the future is instead expressed by a separate word (will, as in she will paint ). Expressions like will paint  are called analytic.
Rhythm Types,,, Assuming that the phonemes that make up words are organized into syllables, modern linguistic theory claims that rhythm is a manifestation of the fact that syllables are further grouped into constituents called feet, which are usually binary groupings of syllables. Standard Metrical Theory takes the grouping of syllables into feet as fundamental for the assignment of bounded primary stress. StressTyp is based on a separation of the treatment of primary and secondary stress. Such a separation has been proposed and defended on theoretical grounds by van der Hulst (1996). We offer several arguments here.
Applicative Constructions,,, In an applicative construction, the number of object arguments selected by the predicate is increased by one with respect to the basic construction. For example, in Tukang Besi (Austronesian; Sulawesi, Indonesia), the verb ‘fetch’ takes one theme object in the basic construction (as shown in 1a), but with the applicative marker it takes two objects, theme and benefactive (as shown in 1b).
Other Roles of Applied Objects,,, It is sometimes hard to tell from grammatical descriptions whether benefactive is differentiated from recipient/goal, or other common roles associated with the applied object. It is also unclear how many languages merge benefactive and malefactive (the adversely affected object); impressionistically it seems more typical to keep them apart. In addition, the applied object can be mapped onto a possessor, whose place in the hierarchy of semantic roles is not quite clear. Benefactives, goals, and possessors are typically animate participants, which may create an impression that the applied object has to be an animate participant. Indeed, in some languages (e.g., Halkomelem) the referent of the applied object must be animate regardless of its semantic role (Gerdts 1988a; Gerdts 1993.) In some languages, e.g. Kinyarwanda, the linear order of the base and applied object varies depending on animacy (Kimenyi 1988; Polinsky and Kozinsky 1992; Polinsky 1995). Overall, animacy probably constitutes a separate dimension in the semantics of the applied object.
The Past Tense,,, In (1) the form of the finite verb (in this case, the copula is/was) depends on what time we are talking about – what we may call the topic time (following Klein (1994)): the present form is  is used if the topic time coincides with the time of speech, and the past form was  if the topic time precedes the time of speech. This is of course a very rough rule in need of a number of further specifications. As was already noted in the introductory chapter, grammaticalized marking of time in the form of tenses is typically independent of considerations of relevance. The fact that time in (1) is also indicated (and more precisely so) by time adverbials does not make tense marking less necessary. Rather, the presence of a deictic time adverbial such as yesterday  renders the use of anything but the simple past tense unacceptable in (1b).
Consonant Inventories,,, This chapter and the next few chapters will look at various aspects of the complexity of the sound resources used in the world’s languages and examine how this complexity is distributed geographically. The first aspect to be examined is the size of the set of consonants used in the language, usually referred to as the consonant inventory. This is one element of what is called the phonology of the language.
Weight Factors in Weight-Sensitive Stress Systems,,, Diacritic weight equals lexical marking. Rhythmic weight was assumed for count systems (cf. Chapter 15, §2.2). The first-mentioned category, intrinsic weight, needs some further comment. The intrinsic properties that determine weight can differ from one language to the next. An important determinant of weight is vowel length, closely followed by syllable closure. In principle, the two factors are independent, but often both long vowels and closing consonants will cause syllables to be heavy for primary and/or secondary stress in one and the same language, leaving the light category for open, short-voweled syllables. Vowel length and syllable closure are sometimes referred to as quantitative weight.
Nominal and Verbal Conjunction,,, In the European languages, the same marker is used both for conjunction of noun phrases and for conjunction of verb phrases and clauses, as illustrated in (1) for Hungarian (and for English in the translation). Thus, Hungarian és  and English and  can conjoin both nominal and verbal/clausal constituents.
Subtypes of Asymmetric Standard Negation,,, The term standard negation refers to the basic way(s) a language has for negating declarative verbal main clauses. In symmetric negation affirmative and negative structures are identical except for the presence of the negative marker(s), whereas in asymmetric negation the structure of negatives differs from the structure of affirmatives in various other ways too. Structural differences, i.e. asymmetry, can be found either between the affirmative and negative constructions or between the paradigms that the affirmative and negative constructions form. These distinctions are defined and illustrated in connection with Map 113A, which shows the geographical distribution of symmetric and asymmetric standard negation.
Number of Non-Derived Basic Colour Categories,,, The following four maps (132A, 133A, 134A, 135A) show the distribution of colour terms in some of the world's languages, based on the World Color Survey. This project, a collaboration of researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), collected colour-naming data from 110 languages being studied by SIL linguist-translators in the late 1970s. For further details on methods and results of the World Color Survey see Kay et al. (1991), Kay and Berlin (1997), Kay et al. (1997), Hardin and Maffi (1997), Kay and Maffi (1999).
Order of Numeral and Noun,,, This map shows the order of cardinal numerals with respect to a noun they modify. Cardinal numerals are words denoting the number of things referred to, as in English four chairs, in contrast to ordinal numerals, which specify the rank in some order of objects, as in English the fourth chair.

Periphrastic Causative Constructions,,, The causative construction is a linguistic expression which denotes a complex situation consisting of two component events (Comrie 1989: 165-166; Song 2001: 256-259): (i) the causing event, in which the causer does or initiates something; and (ii) the caused event, in which the causee carries out an action, or undergoes a change of condition or state as a result of the causer’s action. The following sentence in Kinyarwanda (Bantu; Central East Africa) is such a linguistic expression.
Ditransitive Constructions: The Verb 'Give',,, Ditransitive verbs are verbs with two arguments in addition to the subject: a “recipient” or “addressee” argument, and a “theme” argument. Typical ditransitive verb meanings are ‘give’, ‘sell’, ‘bring’, ‘tell’. Since different ditransitive verbs occur in different constructions in many languages, only a single verb meaning was taken into account for this chapter: the verb ‘give’, which is probably the most frequent ditransitive verb in all languages.
Adjectives without Nouns,,, Adjectives may occur either as predicates, for example This apple is red, or within noun phrases. When within noun phrases, they typically function as attributes to nouns, for example I want the red apple. However, in some cases, when the noun is either unimportant or is reconstructible from the discourse, it is absent from the construction, and, as a result, the adjective remains as the main lexical item within the noun phrase, denoting the understood object. An example of such a construction is the following:
Tone,,, All languages make use of variations in the musical pitch of the voice as part of their sound systems, but they differ in the ways in which modifications of pitch are used and how many different types of functions are served by pitch variations. Linguists distinguish between two of the major uses of pitch as tone and intonation. Intonation is the term that is used to describe sentence types, such as question versus statement, or to indicate whether a speaker has finished or intends to continue speaking, or to show which parts of an utterance present new or highlighted information versus old or less significant information.
Locus of Marking in the Clause,,, Locus is a convenient one-word term for what is also known as head/dependent marking. In any kind of phrase, overt morphosyntactic marking reflecting the syntactic relations within the phrase may be located on the head of the phrase, on a non-head (i.e. on a dependent), on both, or on neither. In clauses, the arguments are dependents and the verb is the head. Examples of the locus types in clauses are (1)-(4). For ease of illustration these examples show the treatment of subjects and objects, in languages that treat both identically. As discussed below, not all languages treat subjects and objects identically, and where they are treated differently we have mapped the treatment of objects (specifically, direct objects (P below)). Not all languages treat pronoun and noun arguments identically, and where they are treated differently we have mapped the treatment of nouns.
Voicing in Plosives and Fricatives,,, As noted in Chapter 5, one of the major ways that consonants differ from each other is in the accompanying action of the larynx, with the most typical larynx settings being one which allows air to flow freely between the vocal folds vs. one in which the vocal folds vibrate to produce regular voicing. One aspect of this opposition between voiced and voiceless consonants is discussed in Chapter 5. In this chapter the distribution of a contrast between voiced and voiceless counterparts in the two major classes of consonants within which this contrast commonly occurs will be discussed. These two classes of consonants are the plosives and fricatives. Plosives are the kinds of sounds usually associated with the letters p, t, k; b, d, g, in which air flow from the lungs is interrupted by a complete closure being made in the mouth. Fricatives are the kinds of sounds usually associated with letters such as f, s; v, z, in which the air passes through a narrow constriction that causes the air to flow turbulently and thus create a noisy sound. The other classes of consonants which are found in the majority of languages (nasals, "liquids" and vowel-like approximants) are voiced in the overwhelming majority of cases.
Position of Pronominal Possessive Affixes,,, Note that the term possessive affix is used by different linguists for two very different sorts of affixes. This chapter uses the term for affixes like those in (1) which code the person, number, and/or gender of a possessor and which appear on a noun denoting the entity which is possessed. The term is occasionally used for what will be called here genitive affixes, case affixes which occur on nouns denoting possessors, to indicate that these nouns denote the possessor of something expressed by a separate noun, as illustrated by the example in (2) from Archi (Nakh-Daghestanian; Russia).
Passive Constructions,,, The three examples of passive clauses given so far are personal passives, i.e. passives with an overt lexical subject. Personal passives are typically seen as involving a process of agent demotion (from subject to oblique role or total suppression) and a process of patient promotion (from direct object to subject). There are also passive clauses which involve only agent demotion. These are called impersonal passives. An example of an impersonal passive is given in (3b) from Kannada (Dravidian; southern India).
Alignment of Case Marking of Pronouns,,, The core argument of a canonical, one-place intransitive predicate may be symbolized S. The two core arguments of a canonical, two-place transitive predicate may be symbolized as A and P, with A representing the more agent-like argument and P the more patient-like (Comrie 1978). (In another terminology, the symbol O is used rather than P; Dixon 1994.) In studying the alignment of case marking, we ask the question which of S, A, and P are coded identically and which are coded differently. Note that for the purposes of this chapter, only case marking is considered. Alignment of person marking in the verb is treated in Chapter 100. Other manifestations of alignment are also possible, such as word order, but are not treated here.
Position of Interrogative Phrases in Content Questions,,, Content questions differ from polar questions (see Maps 92A and 116A) in that they elicit a specific answer other than ‘yes’ or ‘no’, and in containing interrogative phrases. All languages have a set of interrogative words that are characteristic of content questions, though in many languages they are identical in form to indefinite words (like someone  in English) (see Map 46A). These interrogative words typically belong to different categories (interrogative pronouns, interrogative adverbs, “interrogative adjectives”, “interrogative verbs”). Because most interrogative words in English begin with wh-, content questions in English are often called wh-questions. Although interrogative phrases often consist of single words (interrogative pronouns or interrogative adverbs), they may contain additional words, as in which book  in (1b).
Predicative Possession,,, This map illustrates the areal distribution of the various encoding options for predicative possession. The data base for this map thus includes sentences in which ownership of a certain object (the possessed item) is predicated of a possessor, in a way that is illustrated by the English sentence John has a motorcycle. It should be noted that the scope of this map is restricted by several conditions. First, the map deals only with the encoding of predicative possession, as in John has a motorcycle; cases of adnominal possession (as in John’s motorcycle) are not dealt with. Secondly, within predicative possession it often matters whether the noun phrase that indicates the possessed item is indefinite or not. English is a language in which this parameter gives rise to two different encoding options (see 1a-b). For the purposes of this map, only constructions in which the possessed NP has an indefinite reading - i.e., only those constructions that are parallel to (1a) - have been taken into account.
Indefinite Pronouns,,, This chapter examines indefinite pronouns like 'somebody' and 'something' and distinguishes two major types. On the one hand, they may be closely related to the interrogative pronouns 'who' and 'what', as in Russian, where kto-to  'somebody' and čto-to  'something' are derived from kto  'who' and čto  'what' by means of the indefinite suffix -to. On the other hand, they may be closely related to the generic nouns 'person' and 'thing', as in Persian, where 'somebody' is expressed as kæs-i  [person-indef] and 'something' is expressed as čiz-i  [thing-indef]. In addition to the two major types, there are some languages with special expressions for 'somebody' and 'something', unrelated to anything else. An example is Abkhaz (Northwest Caucasian), where 'somebody' is aj˚ə̀  and 'something' is ak'ə̀  (Hewitt 1979: 158). Theoretically one might expect further types, e.g. indefinites derived from demonstrative pronouns, but no other types have been found.

Order of Negative Morpheme and Verb,,, Not considered are negative constructions involving more than simple clausal negation, like (2a), or clauses with nonverbal predicates, like (2b) to (2d), in languages where one or more of these is treated differently from clauses with verbal predicates, negative imperative (prohibitive) sentences, like (2e), or constituent negation, where a non-verbal constituent is the focus of the negation, as in (2f).

Noun Phrase Conjunction,,, This map shows the distribution of the variation in the encoding of noun phrase conjunction. The basic distinction is between those languages which use a different marker for noun phrase conjunction and comitative phrases (so-called and-languages; Stassen 2000) and those languages in which the markers for noun phrase conjunction and comitative phrases are the same (with-languages). A clear example of an and-language is English. As the examples in (1) demonstrate, in this language the marker of noun phrase conjunction (and ) is different from the marker of comitative phrases (with). In contrast, the example in (2) shows that Nkore-Kiga (Bantu; Uganda) is a with-language: the item na  can be translated as either 'and' or 'with'. An alternative way of stating this is to say that with-languages like Nkore-Kiga lack the structural option of noun phrase conjunction.
M-T Pronouns,,, Personal pronouns, like other closed-class forms, tend to contain nasals and other basic consonants.  However, particular paradigmatic combinations of consonants in particular person-number categories are not especially frequent worldwide. There are only two such combinations that show up interestingly on a map: pronoun sets like English me  and thee  or Nanai (Tungusic; eastern Siberia) mi  'I, me' and si  'you', with m  in the first person and a coronal obstruent in the second, which are common in northern Eurasia and rare elsewhere; and sets like Northeast Maidu (Penutian; California) ni  'I, me' and mi  'you' with n  in the first person and m  in the second, which are common in western America and rare elsewhere. Map 136A here shows the first type, henceforth "m-T"  patterns, and Map 137A the second, henceforth "n-m"  patterns.
M in First Person Singular,,, Nothing found on this topic!
Comparative Constructions,,, In semantic or cognitive terms, comparison can be defined as a mental act by which two objects are assigned a position on a predicative scale. If the positions on the scale are different, then we speak of the comparison of inequality, which finds its linguistic encoding in comparative constructions. Such a construction essentially involves three things: a predicative scale, which, in language, is usually encoded as a gradable predicate, and two objects. Although these objects can, in principle, be complex, the practice of typological linguistic research has been to restrict them to primary objects, which are typically encoded in the form of noun phrases. Thus, a comparative construction typically contains a predicate and two noun phrases, one of which is the object of comparison (the comparee NP), while the other functions as the "yard-stick" of the comparison (the standard NP). In short, prototypical instances of comparative constructions in the languages of the world are sentences that are similar to the English sentence in (1), in which the noun phrase following the item than is the standard NP:
Antipassive Constructions,,, An antipassive construction is a derived detransitivized construction with a two-place predicate, related to a corresponding transitive construction whose predicate is the same lexical item. In the basic transitive construction, the patient-like argument is realized as a direct object; in the antipassive construction, that argument is either suppressed (left implicit) or realized as an oblique complement. The term antipassive (Silverstein 1972) was coined to indicate that the construction is a mirror image of the passive: in the passive, the suppressed or demoted argument is the agent-like argument, in the antipassive, the patient-like argument. An example of a transitive/antipassive alternation is given in (1a-b).
Productivity of the Antipassive Construction,,, Antipassives often apply only to a certain subset of transitive predicates (Gibson 1980; Chung 1998: 39). Productive antipassives show genealogical and areal clustering, as indicated on Map 108B: they are found in some Mayan, Salishan, Nakh-Daghestanian, Austronesian, and Australian languages.
Overlap between Situational and Epistemic Modal Marking,,, Modality is a dimension of meaning that crucially involves notions of possibility and necessity. These may relate to circumstances that allow or necessitate a situation, as in (1). The permission in (1a) is a matter of the speaker allowing a situation, while with the obligation of (1b) the situation of the addressee’s going home is deemed necessary.
Position of Polar Question Particles,,, This map shows the position of question particles in polar questions. Polar questions are ones that elicit the equivalent of a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ response. This map does not include interrogative affixes on verbs, although it should be noted that the distinction between interrogative affixes and separate interrogative particles is often hard to make. The map treats interrogative clitics that can attach to words of different categories as question particles. Map 116A shows the distribution of different ways to signal polar questions, including question particles, but does not show their position in the sentence. A number of languages shown on Map 116A as having question particles are not shown on this map because their position is not clear from available materials.
Order of Person Markers on the Verb,,, Map 104A represents the order of A and P person markers on the verb relative to each other, where A stands for the person marker of the agentive argument of a transitive verb and P for the person marker of the patient argument of the transitive verb. Five values are represented:
Sex-based and Non-sex-based Gender Systems,,, We saw in Chapter 30 how, in many languages, nouns may be divided into groups according to the agreements they take, even when we control for other factors such as number and case. We should then ask whether these groups are arbitrary. The answer is that there is always a semantic “core” to the system. That is, there is an overlap between the nouns which take a particular set of agreements and some semantic feature. (This overlap may be greater or smaller, as we shall see in Chapter 32.) In the familiar systems such as French and German, and indeed in the majority, the link is to biological sex. This was illustrated from Russian, in Chapter 30, and can be seen again in Bininj Gun-Wok (Gunwinygic; northern Australia; Evans et al. 2002: table 1). Here we see agreement of the adjective in gender in the Kunwinjku dialect of the language (older speakers):
Nonperiphrastic Causative Constructions,,, The causative construction is a linguistic expression which denotes a complex situation consisting of two component events (Comrie 1989: 165-166; Song 2001: 256-259): (i) the causing event, in which the causer does or initiates something; and (ii) the caused event, in which the causee carries out an action, or undergoes a change of condition or state as a result of the causer’s action. The following Japanese sentence is such a linguistic expression.
Absence of Common Consonants,,, In the chapter on the size of consonant inventories (Chapter 1) the kinds of sounds that are most often found in the consonant inventories of the world’s languages were briefly discussed. In this chapter the focus is on the absence of some of the classes of sounds which typically occur in the world’s languages, and on where these absences occur. Absences of three classes of consonant sounds — bilabials, fricatives, and nasals — which occur in the vast majority of languages will be discussed. Each of these terms will be defined before discussion of the geographical distribution of the pattern. Absence of a fourth class of common consonants, laterals, is discussed in Chapter 8.
Intensifiers and Reflexive Pronouns,,, Reflexive pronouns (or “reflexive anaphors“) are expressions which are prototypically used to indicate that a non-subject argument of a transitive predicate is coreferential with (or bound by) the subject, i.e. expressions like German sich, Russian sebja, Turkish kendi, Mandarin zìjĭ, English x-self:
The Perfect,,, By perfect we mean a category with approximately the same semantics as the English (Present) Perfect in I have read this book, which is used to express events that took place before the temporal reference point but which have an effect on or are in some way still relevant at that point. This includes at least two related but distinguishable uses:
Finger and Hand,,, The main map of this chapter shows the distribution of the two primary ways in which languages lexically treat the human finger and the hand of which it is a constituent. 'Finger' refers to any one of the hand’s five appendages. ('Fingers' is a collection of two or more of the latter.) 'Hand' is defined as that part of the upper limb from the fingertips to the wrist. Two values are represented:
Verbal Person Marking,,, Map 102A depicts the number and identity of the arguments of a transitive clause which display person marking on the verb. “A” stands for the agentive argument and “P” for the patient argument. Five feature values are represented:
Weight-Sensitive Stress,,, In this chapter we focus on systems in which the placement of stress is sensitive to properties of syllables. In general, if a stress system is sensitive to such properties, this means that syllables fall into two classes, called heavy and light syllables. The former are such that they “attract stress”, while the latter only get stress if they happen to be in the right location in the string of syllables. In some languages, syllable weight has been argued to form a scale with more than two values.
'Want' Complement Subjects,,, This chapter looks at one important aspect of the syntax of 'want': whether the notional subject of its complement predication is left implicit when it is coreferential with the wanter, or whether it is expressed overtly in the complement clause by means of a pronominal element.
Order of Relative Clause and Noun,,, Map 90A shows the order of relative clause and noun. A construction is considered a relative clause for the purposes of this map if it is a clause which, either alone or in combination with a noun, denotes something and if the thing denoted has a semantic role within the relative clause. If there is a noun inside or outside the relative clause that denotes the thing also denoted by the clause, that noun will be referred to as the head of the relative clause. Headless relative clauses (like English what I bought at the store ) are not relevant to this map.
Prenominal relative clauses,,, Maps 90B to 90G primarily expand on the last feature value shown on Map 90A, those languages which lack a single dominant type of relative clause but where there are two types of relative clauses with neither dominant. To show the combination of these two types of relative clauses, each of the six maps corresponds to one of the first six types on Map 90A. For comparison the first feature value on each map shows languages in which that type is the dominant type and is therefore identical to the corresponding feature value on Map 90A.

Adjoined relative clauses,,, Nothing found on this topic!
Order of Adverbial Subordinator and Clause,,, This map shows the position of adverbial subordinators, morphemes which mark adverbial clauses for their semantic relationship to the main clause. Adverbial subordinators which are separate words are referred to as subordinating conjunctions  by traditional grammar. Examples of adverbial subordinators in English include because, although, when, while, and if. The map further distinguishes adverbial subordinators which are separate words from ones which are affixes on verbs.
Predicative Adjectives,,, This map shows the distribution of the various options in the encoding of predicative adjectives, i.e. items which predicate a property of a subject. The basic distinction is between those languages in which predicative adjectives are encoded in a way that is parallel to predicative verbs, and those languages in which the encoding of predicative adjectives and verbs is different. An example of this latter, nonverbal, encoding of predicative adjectives is English. As shown in the sentences in (1), English shows third person agreement in the present tense of its predicative verbs, but this option is not available for predicative adjectives: *John tall-s is not acceptable in the language. On the other hand, Bororo (Macro-Gê; Mato Grosso, Brazil) offers an instance of verbal encoding of predicative adjectives; as the sentences in (2) demonstrate, the encoding of predicative verbs and of predicative “property words” is identical.
Prefixing vs. Suffixing in Inflectional Morphology,,, Languages were assigned a prefixing index and a suffixing index in the following way. For each affix type above for which the language predominantly employs prefixes, one point was assigned to the prefixing index for the language, and analogously for the suffixing index. If for a given affix type, a language has both prefixes and suffixes with neither deemed dominant, half a point was added to both the prefixing index and the suffixing index of the language. However, the first three affix types in the above list were considered sufficiently important that they were assigned twice as many points as the other affix types: for each of these affix types, if a language predominantly employs prefixes, two points were added to the prefixing index of the language and analogously for suffixes. If for one of these three types, a language has both prefixes and suffixes with neither deemed dominant, one point was added to both the prefixing index and the suffixing index of the language. In the discussion below, I will refer to the sum of the prefixing index and the suffixing index as the affixing index. Note that the number of distinct morphemes of a given type was not considered: for example, a language with a single tense-aspect suffix was coded the same as a language with many tense-aspect suffixes. Derivational affixes and other types of inflectional affixes were not considered.
Epistemic Possibility,,, The map gives some indication of the strategies used to express epistemic possibility in positive main clauses. Three types of languages are distinguished. The definitions refer to three types of marking: verbal constructions, affixes on verbs, and other constructions, ordered in terms of increasing cross-linguistic frequency. Languages of the first type use the least frequent markers, whether or not they also use the more frequent ones. Languages of the second type use the medium frequency markers, whether or not they also use the most frequent ones. Languages of the third type only use the most frequent markers.
Order of Genitive and Noun,,, This map shows the order of a genitive or possessor noun phrase with respect to the head noun. In the example in (1) from Finnish, tytön  ‘the girl’s’ is the genitive noun phrase, while kissa  ‘cat’ is the head noun, so the order in Finnish is GenN (genitive preceding head noun).
Polar Questions,,, This map shows the method a language uses to indicate that an utterance is a polar question. Polar questions are ones to which the expected answer is the equivalent of ‘yes’ or ‘no’ (and which are thus sometimes called yes-no questions ). They contrast with content questions, which contain an interrogative word meaning something like ‘who’ or ‘where’, in which some more specific answer is expected; content questions in English are often called wh-questions. 
Person Marking on Adpositions,,, This map gives a survey of the distribution of languages with person markers on their adpositions. An example of a person-marked preposition is found in (1) from Maybrat (West Papuan; Papua, Indonesia).
Symmetric and Asymmetric Standard Negation,,, Standard negation can be defined as the basic way (or ways) a language has for negating declarative verbal main clauses. Negative constructions that fall outside standard negation include the negation of existential, copular or non-verbal clauses, the negation of subordinate clauses, and the negation of non-declarative clauses like imperatives (see Chapter 71). These negatives are not taken into account here, but it is of course possible that languages use their standard negation constructions for the negation of these clause types too.This map shows how symmetric and asymmetric standard negation are distributed among the languages of the world. In symmetric negation the structure of the negative is identical to the structure of the affirmative, except for the presence of the negative marker(s). In asymmetric negation the structure of the negative differs from the structure of the affirmative in various other ways too, i.e. there is asymmetry between affirmation and negation. Affirmative and negative structures can be symmetric or asymmetric in two ways: there can be (a)symmetry either between the affirmative and negative constructions, or between the paradigms that the affirmative and negative constructions form. Symmetric negative constructions do not differ from the corresponding affirmative constructions in any other way than by the presence of the negative marker(s), whereas asymmetric negative constructions show structural differences in comparison to the corresponding affirmative constructions. In symmetric paradigms, all (verbal) categories or forms have corresponding affirmative and negative forms, whereas in asymmetric paradigms such one-to-one correspondences do not obtain.
Order of Adposition and Noun Phrase,,, This map shows the order of adposition and noun phrase.  The two primary types of adpositions are prepositions and postpositions: prepositions precede the noun phrase they occur with, as in English and in the Boumaa Fijian (Austronesian) example in (1a), while postpositions follow the noun phrase they occur with, as in the Lezgian (Nakh-Daghestanian; Russia) example in (1b).
Para-Linguistic Usages of Clicks,,, Clicks are acoustically salient speech sounds formed by the sudden opening of a closure resulting in a sharp inflow of air towards a secondary occlusion at the back of the mouth. As phonemes, the basic building blocks of words, clicks are very limited in their geographic distribution. Phonemic clicks occur only in southern Africa, plus a little pocket further to the northeast, in Tanzania; elsewhere in the world, they are absent. The limited distribution of phonemic clicks is displayed in Map 19A.However, click sounds are actually very common throughout the world, in a variety of usages which might be termed para-linguistic. A familiar example is the English sound which, when repeated, is spelled either as tut tut  or as tsk tsk.The para-linguistic nature of such clicks is reflected in a number of exceptional features. Phonetically, they involve sounds lying outside ordinary phonemic inventories. Grammatically, they are not integrated into morphological and syntactic structures. And semantically, they convey a very restricted range of meanings, some of which are associated with the expression of emotions.
Reduplication,,, The repetition of phonological material within a word for semantic or grammatical purposes is known as reduplication, a widely used morphological device in a number of the world’s languages. The languages classified on the accompanying map are sorted into three categories: languages that do not employ reduplication as a grammatical device, languages that productively employ both partial and full reduplication, and languages that only employ full reduplication.Full reduplication is the repetition of an entire word, word stem (root with one or more affixes), or root. Examples are Nez Perce (Sahaptian; northwestern United States) full word lexical reduplication: té:mul  ‘hail’ vs. temulté:mul  ‘sleet’ (Aoki 1963: 43), or Tagalog full root reduplication, shown here with the verbalizing prefix mag-, where the reduplicant isip  is identical to the base isip  ‘think’: mag-isip  ‘to think’ vs. mag-isip-isip  ‘to think about seriously.’
Fusion of Selected Inflectional Formatives,,, Since its beginning in the 19th century, morphological typology has postulated a universal scale of less vs. more tightly packed word forms. The scale ranges from isolating to agglutinative to fusional to introflexive, and is canonically exemplified by Chinese (isolating), Turkish (agglutinative), Latin (fusional) and Modern Standard Arabic (introflexive). Recent research has shown that such a scale conflates many different typological variables and incorrectly assumes that these parameters covary universally (see Plank 1999, Bickel and Nichols 2005, among others). Three prominent variables involved in this are phonological fusion, formative exponence, and flexivity (i.e. allomorphy, inflectional classes). In this chapter we concentrate on fusion. For exponence, see Chapter 21, and for one aspect of flexivity, see Chapter 59 (on possessive classification).
Number of Genders,,, In some languages gender is evident in almost every phrase, while in other languages it is absent. This contrast raises interesting questions as to its function. Equally, in some languages it is relatively easy to determine the type of gender system and to establish how many genders the language has, while in others it takes careful analysis. 
Occurrence of Nominal Plurality,,, This map shows the extent to which plural markers on full nouns are used in a language (full nouns are nouns which are not pronouns; see Chapter 35 for the plural of personal pronouns). Plural markers can have different formal manifestations (see Chapter 33), which play no role in this chapter. Here we look only at the occurrence of plural markers, which varies along at least two dimensions: animacy and obligatoriness. In the animacy dimension, the most important contrast is between animate (especially human) nouns and inanimate nouns, which are treated differently in many languages (see §2.1 for animal nouns, which are neither human nor inanimate). In the obligatoriness dimension, I distinguish here between non-occurrence, optional occurrence and obligatory occurrence. When these two dimensions are combined, we get the six values shown in the feature-value box.
Syncretism in Verbal Person/Number Marking,,, This map records instances of syncretism in the inflectional marking of subject person in verbs. For example, in German, the same form is regularly used for both 1st and 3rd person subjects in the plural, e.g. machen  ‘(we/they) make’ or machten  ‘(we/they) made’. 
Relationship between the Order of Object and Verb and the Order of Relative Clause and Noun,,, This is the second of three maps that show the relationship between two features that are shown separately in earlier maps, namely the order of relative clause and noun (Map 90A) and the order of object and verb (Map 83A). The two orders of object and verb and the two orders of relative clause and noun intersect to define the first four values shown in the value table.
Negative Indefinite Pronouns and Predicate Negation,,, Negative indefinite pronouns like 'nobody', 'nothing', 'nowhere' may or may not co-occur with the ordinary marker of predicate negation. A language where they always co-occur with predicate negation is Russian. In (1a-b), omission of the predicate negator ne  would render the sentences ungrammatical.
Writing Systems,,, This map is concerned with the linguistic structure of different writing systems, in particular the unit of linguistic structure that is represented most directly in the writing system in question. Five basic systems can be represented, as given in 1–5 in the feature box; mixed systems are also possible, although only one, number 6 in the feature box, is included in the Map 141A.
N-M Pronouns,,, Personal pronouns, like other closed-class forms, tend to contain nasals and other basic consonants.  However, particular paradigmatic combinations of consonants in particular person-number categories are not especially frequent worldwide. There are only two such combinations that show up interestingly on a map: pronoun sets like English me  and thee  or Nanai (Tungusic; eastern Siberia) mi  'I, me' and si  'you', with m  in the first person and a coronal obstruent in the second, which are common in northern Eurasia and rare elsewhere; and sets like Northeast Maidu (Penutian; California) ni  'I, me' and mi  'you' with n  in the first person and m  in the second, which are common in western America and rare elsewhere. Map 136A here shows the first type, henceforth "m-T"  patterns, and Map 137A the second, henceforth "n-m"  patterns.The maps here are based on the first and second person singular forms only. They survey the first consonant in the pronoun root, whether it is word-initial as in Wintu (Penutian; California) ni  'I, me; we, us' or follows an initial vowel as in Nez Perce (Sahaptian; Idaho and Oregon) 'iin  'I, me'. (Whether written or not, the glottal stop that precedes an initial vowel is not considered the first consonant. The Nez Perce form just cited begins with such a glottal stop.) They survey three pronominal forms: independent pronoun words like English I, me, you; possessive affixes as in Hungarian ház-am  'my house', ház-ad  'your house'; and verbal affixes as in Rama (Chibchan; Nicaragua) n-taak-i  'I am going', m-taak-i  'you are going' (Grinevald 1988). (Of course, not all languages have all three series.) They consider the two most widely distributed allomorphs of each, e.g. English I  and me  for first person singular.

Green and Blue,,, In recent models of the universals and evolution theory of basic colour terms, stemming originally from Berlin and Kay (1969), three kinds of universal colour categories are recognized (Kay and McDaniel 1978, Kay et al. 1991, Kay et al. 1997, Kay and Maffi 1999): primary colour categories, composite (disjunctive) colour categories, and derived (intersective) colour categories.First, there are the six primary colours recognized in the widely accepted theory of colour opponency (Hering 1964 [1920], Jameson and Hurvich 1968; Hurvich 1982):BlackWhiteRedYellowGreenBlueThese are the two pairs of fundamental opponent chromatic colours <Red, Green> and <Yellow, Blue> and the single pair of fundamental achromatic colours <Black, White>. Black and white are not opposed in the same sense as the chromatic pairs. For example, we can see a combination of black and white (gray) but there is no sensation consisting of the combination of red and green or of blue and yellow. (That blue and yellow pigments can be mixed to produce a green pigment is not relevant; there are no bluish yellow or yellowish blue sensations.)
Alignment of Verbal Person Marking,,, Languages differ not only in regard to the number and nature of the arguments displaying verbal person marking (see Chapter 102), but also in the alignment of the person markers. The term alignment may be intuitively understood as reflecting how the two arguments of the transitive verb, the agentive argument (A) and the more patient-like argument (P), align with the sole argument of the intransitive verb, the S. In Map 100A the alignments of verbal person markers are represented by the following six values:
Exponence of Selected Inflectional Formatives,,, Exponence refers to the number of categories that cumulate into a single formative. The universal default is to express each category by a dedicated formative. These are monoexponential (or separative) formatives. Polyexponential (or cumulative) formatives, i.e. formatives which simultaneously code more than one category, are much rarer. A well-known example is number and case in many Indo-European languages. Marking of case in these languages involves the same formative as marking of number, and it is impossible to identify separate markers of case and number. Thus, in Russian, genitive singular is -i or -a and genitive plural -ej or -ov or -ø, and there is no element in these forms that exclusively expresses case or number. When categories are not cumulated into a single formative, each has its own separate marker. This is so in Turkish, where number is always expressed on nouns by means of the suffix -ler and for each case there is a separate suffix that can combine with -ler, e.g. genitive -in (plural -ler-in), accusative -i (plural -ler-i ), dative -e (plural -ler-e), etc.Exponence is a purely morphological notion; in particular it is independent of the phonological connection between host and formative. Therefore, monoexponential formatives can combine with any fusion type (see Chapter 20 for the definition of fusion types). Thus, the Fijian past tense formative aa (see example (1) in Chapter 20) is monoexponential and isolating. The Turkish past tense formative -ti (and its alternants) is monoexponential and concatenative. The Kisi high tone past perfective formative is monoexponential and nonlinear.

Case Syncretism,,, This map shows instances of case syncretism in nominals (nouns, pronouns and adjectives). We identify case syncretism when a single inflected form corresponds to two or more case functions. The criterion used here for identifying case functions is form-based: a distinct morphosyntactic case is recognised for a language if it is ever correlated with a formal inflectional distinction (Comrie 1991: 44-47). For example, in Krongo, subject and object forms are never distinguished, so this is not construed as an example of case syncretism, but rather as a single nominative-accusative case (see (1)). However, the dative case is distinct in nouns but identical to this nominative-accusative form in pronouns, so a dative = nominative-accusative syncretism is recognised for Krongo. The formal criteria for identifying syncretism may also be found within the paradigm of a single word, as in Central Yup’ik, where the absolutive and relative (a case combining the functions of ergative and genitive) are distinct in the singular but not in the plural or dual (see (2)).
Tea,,, This chapter differs from most of the chapters in the atlas in several ways, the focus being on the actual phonological shape of a lexical item expressing a particular concept - moreover, one that is definitely not part of the universal heritage of mankind but rather is connected to a specific agricultural product. What is shown on the map are the sources of the words for ‘tea’ in various languages in the world, illustrating in a somewhat peculiar way the spread of words together with material culture. In particular, the map shows the importance of long-distance contacts, such as the trade relations between European countries and East Asia, and is thus a healthy reminder of the fact that languages need not be geographically contiguous to influence each other. Also, in contrast to, for example, the patterns illustrated in the chapters on M-T and N-M pronouns (Chapters 136-137), which presumably go far back in linguistic prehistory, the distribution of words for ‘tea’ depends on quite recent historical processes.
Locus of Marking: Whole-language Typology,,, Locus is a convenient one-word term for what is also known as head/dependent marking. In any kind of phrase, overt morphosyntactic marking reflecting the syntactic relations within the phrase may be located on the head of the phrase, on a non-head (i.e. on a dependent), on both, or on neither. In possessive phrases, the possessed noun is head and the possessor is dependent. Examples illustrating marking of various kinds in possessive phrases are given in Chapter 24. In clauses, the arguments are dependents and the verb is the head. Examples of the locus types in clauses are given in Chapter 23. The division into head, dependent, double, and zero marking does not exhaust the possible types; see the same chapters for examples of additional minor locus patterns.
Zero Marking of A and P Arguments,,, Nothing found on this topic!
The Associative Plural,,, Associative plural constructions consist of a noun X (typically of human reference, usually a person's name or a kin term) and some other material, most often an affix, a clitic, or a word. The meaning of the construction is ‘X and other people associated with X’. An example is Japanese Tanaka-tachi  ‘Tanaka and his associates’.
Relationship between the Order of Object and Verb and the Order of Adjective and Noun,,, This map shows the relationship between the order of object and verb and the order of adjective and noun; these two features are shown on Maps 83A and 87A. This map is the third map showing the relationship between two typological features. Unlike the two previous maps, however, there is no correlation between the features or implicational relationship relating them: all four types defined on the intersection of these two features, the first four types shown in the value table, are common.
Order of Object and Verb,,, This map shows the dominant order of lexical (nonpronominal) object and verb. As with Map 81A, the notion of object is defined semantically, as the P or most patient-like argument (see discussion under Map 81A) in a transitive clause. The primary types shown are languages which are OV (in which the object precedes the verb), illustrated by Turkish in (1a), and languages which are VO (in which the verb precedes the object), illustrated in (1b) by Gulf Arabic, the variety of colloquial Arabic spoken in Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and eastern Saudi Arabia.
Position of Tense-Aspect Affixes,,, This map shows the position of tense-aspect affixes. The primary distinction is between tense-aspect prefixes, as illustrated by the past tense prefix ā-  in (1a) from Anywa (Nilotic; Ethiopia and Sudan), and tense-aspect suffixes, illustrated by the imperfective suffix -n  in (1b) from Harar Oromo (Cushitic, Afro-Asiatic; Ethiopia).
Alignment of Case Marking of Full Noun Phrases,,, These two maps are concerned with the ways in which core argument noun phrases are marked — by means of morphological case or adpositions — to indicate which particular core argument position they occupy. The first map is concerned with full noun phrases, the second with pronouns.The core argument of a canonical, one-place intransitive predicate may be symbolized S. The two core arguments of a canonical, two-place transitive predicate may be symbolized as A and P, with A representing the more agent-like argument and P the more patient-like (Comrie 1978). (In another terminology, the symbol O is used rather than P; Dixon 1994.) In studying the alignment of case marking, we ask the question which of S, A, and P are coded identically and which are coded differently. Note that for the purposes of this chapter, only case marking is considered. Alignment of person marking in the verb is treated in Chapter 100. Other manifestations of alignment are also possible, such as word order, but are not treated here.
The Future Tense,,, In English, the sentence It is cold tomorrow, with the present tense of the copula is, sounds strange: it is more natural to say It will (it’ll) be cold tomorrow  or It is going to be cold tomorrow, using a future tense form. In Finnish, on the other hand, one may replace the adverb tänään  ‘today’ in (1) with huomenna  ‘tomorrow’, yielding (2) without any further changes in the sentence.
Definite Articles,,, This map shows information regarding definite articles. For the purposes of this map, a definite article is a morpheme which accompanies nouns and which codes definiteness or specificity, like ‘the’ in English. This is a somewhat broader use of the term definite article  than is common, since it includes (i) affixes on nouns that code definiteness; and (ii) demonstratives, if those demonstratives are used as markers of definiteness. In many languages, words that are demonstratives, either in the sense that they can be used deictically with an accompanying gesture or in the sense that they exhibit a distinction in terms of distance (as in the contrast of this  and that  in English), are also widely used in contexts where English would use a definite article rather than a demonstrative.
Lateral Consonants,,, In their consonant inventories most of the languages in the world have a consonant sound similar to that represented by the l in English lake, Spanish lobo ‘wolf’, or Indonesian laki ‘husband’. The technical phonetic description of sounds of this type is that they are voiced lateral approximants produced at the dental or alveolar place of articulation. The word lateral in this description refers to the fact that during their production the flow of air originating from the lungs is directed around a region of contact between the tongue and the roof of the mouth which leaves a passage for the air to escape to one or both sides of this central closure. The size of the channel through which the air flows is wide enough that the flow is unimpeded and does not create friction noise as it passes, and the vocal folds are in the normal position to produce voicing vibrations in the same way as is typical during vowel sounds. Sounds with lateral airflow are most often produced with the tip or blade of the tongue making contact with the back of the upper teeth or at a position just behind the teeth; hence they are labeled dental or alveolar. If you pronounce the “l-sound” of a language familiar to you but then keep the tongue in the same position and draw the breath quickly inwards the colder inward-flowing air will help you feel where the side passage for airflow is located.In this chapter the occurrence of laterals of this common type and of various other kinds of lateral consonants that are less frequently found will be described, as well as the distribution of languages that have no lateral consonants. As in other chapters discussing aspects of consonant inventories, the set of sounds under consideration is the set of contrasting sounds as represented by their most typical pronunciation (see Chapter 1).
Voicing and Gaps in Plosive Systems,,, In this chapter we will look at some patterns found within the sets of stop consonant sounds in the world’s languages. It will emerge that two well-known patterns, here labeled "missing /p/" and "missing /g/", which were previously considered to reflect universal phonetic factors in an equal way, are quite differently distributed. This difference suggests that these patterns are not in fact parallel.
Relativization on Subjects,,, According to the Accessibility Hierarchy of Relativization (subject > direct object > indirect object > possessor) proposed in Keenan and Comrie (1977), it is easier to relativize on subjects than it is to relativize on any of the other positions, easier to relativize on direct objects than indirect objects, etc. One of the generalizations that has been made regarding the accessibility hierarchy is that the pronoun retention strategy is preferred at the lower end of the hierarchy. This finds substantial confirmation in the present study, in that several languages use pronoun retention for relativizing upon obliques but not for relativizing upon subjects. In fact, few languages use pronoun-retention to relativize upon subjects
Numeral Classifiers,,, In English and in other languages, nouns may vary with respect to the property of countability. Nouns of high countability such as woman, dog and pencil  denote objects which are conceptualized in terms of highly individuated units typically associated with a characteristic shape. In contrast, nouns of low countability such as water, sand  and smoke  denote objects which are conceptualized in terms of masses without unitary structure or characteristic shape.Countability bears a number of grammatical consequences, one of which is the way in which nouns may occur in construction with numerals. Nouns of high countability generally occur in direct construction with numerals, for example one woman, two dogs, three pencils. In contrast, nouns of low countability typically do not occur in direct construction with numerals; instead, an additional item must be present, for example one glass of water, two pounds of sand, three plumes of smoke. Such additional items are sometimes referred to as mensural numeral classifiers, since they provide nouns of low countability with a unit of measure by means of which they may then be counted.
Number of Cases,,, Morphological case on nominals is a common device to express the syntactic and semantic relationships between clausal constituents. However, the languages of the world that use this strategy vary greatly with respect to the number of case categories represented in their inflectional system. It is the purpose of this map to display this numerical variation in the productive case paradigms of substantives (full nouns) in 261 languages. Deviant case inventories found in minor word classes of particular languages are dealt with in Chapter 50.
Semantic Distinctions of Evidentiality,,, This map and the one following it show the presence of grammatical markers of evidentiality. On this map the semantic coding of evidentiality is represented, while Map 78A deals with the morphological coding of evidentiality.
Possessive Classification,,, Many languages have more than one way of forming possessive noun phrases. English, for example, has a choice between the "Saxon genitive" (Mary's house, the director's office, the day's end) and the "Norman genitive" (the office of the director, the end of the month), conditioned in part by the part of speech and semantics of the possessor but with considerable overlap and stylistic variation.In contrast, many languages have an opposition of two (or sometimes more) forms of possessive marking whose choice is conditioned not by semantics or style, as in English, but lexically; and conditioned not by properties of the possessor but by the possessed noun, i.e. by the head noun in the construction. (The possessed nouns in the English examples above are house, office, and end.) Consider the examples in (1) from Mesa Grande Diegueño (Yuman; California), where the noun 'mother' takes the simple prefix ʔ-  'my' while 'house' takes the compound prefix ʔə-nʸ-.
Third Person Zero of Verbal Person Marking,,, Map 103A represents the distribution of third person zeroes among verbal person markers of the sole argument of an intransitive clause (i.e. of the S argument). I have chosen to depict the person marking of the S rather than of either of the transitive arguments, as the verbal person markers of the latter are sometimes fused with each other (see Chapter 104), which makes it difficult to decide which one has a zero realization.
Front Rounded Vowels,,, The lip position of vowels is generally correlated with the height and backness of the vowel, as discussed in Chapter 2. Normally vowels which are back and not low are pronounced with the lips in a rounded position (e.g. [o] and [u]). Front and central vowels and back low vowels are normally pronounced with the lips unrounded (e.g. [i], [e], [a]). Lip rounding involves drawing the corners of the lips together and protruding the lips forward from their normal rest position. The ability to make these gestures with the lips is greatest when the vowel is high; as the jaw is opened further to make progressively lower vowels, the amount of adjustment of the lips that is possible becomes more limited, since the lips are being stretched vertically. This mechanical constraint may account for the fact that low vowels are normally unrounded, whether front or back. As for non-low vowels, the association of lip rounding with back vowels has to do with reinforcing the low-pitched acoustic overtones that are characteristic of back vowels. Rounding and protruding the lips lowers the frequencies of the acoustic resonances of the vocal tract to add to the lowering effect produced by the action of backing the body of the tongue. A rounded back vowel is therefore more clearly distinct from other vowels than an unrounded one (see Stevens 1972).Although the occurrence of lip rounding with back non-low vowels is the normal pattern, front vowels with lip rounding and back non-low vowels without lip rounding do both occur in the inventories of vowels of a minority of languages. This chapter will focus on the occurrence of one class of these less usual vowels, the front rounded vowels. In the sample of languages surveyed for this chapter, there are only 37 languages (about 6.6%) in which one or more such vowels are recognized as part of the vowel inventory as defined in Chapter 2.
Conjunctions and Universal Quantifiers,,, Conjunctions are forms with meanings similar to that of English and. Universal quantifiers are expressions with meanings resembling those of English every, each, and all.Logicians, as well as logically-minded linguists, have suggested that there is a close affinity between conjunctions and universal quantifiers. For example, in the context of a class consisting of five students, Alice, Bill, John, Mary and Susan, sentence (1) with the conjoined NP Alice, Bill, John, Mary and Susan  is logically equivalent to sentence (2) with the universally quantified noun phrase every student.
The Morphological Imperative,,, The first type shown on the map includes languages that have special morphological marking both for the imperative second singular and for the imperative second plural, as in example (1) from Limbu (Tibeto-Burman; Nepal).
Hand and Arm,,, This map shows the distribution of the two primary ways in which languages lexically recognize major segments of the human upper limb. The major segments are 'hand,' from the fingertips to the wrist, and 'arm,' from the fingertips or from the wrist to the shoulder. 
Gender Distinctions in Independent Personal Pronouns,,, Independent personal pronouns, in contrast to bound forms (i.e. clitics and affixes), are separate words capable of taking primary stress. Virtually all languages have independent personal pronouns, though in some they occur rather infrequently. Gender, as defined by Corbett (1991), is a form of classification of nominals, as shown by agreement (see Map 30A). Most gender contrasts on personal pronouns are sex-based, i.e. pronouns used for male referents are masculine and those used for females are feminine. The treatment of other referents varies. They may be referred to by a separate set (or sets) of neuter pronouns, as is the case in English and many other European languages. Alternatively, they may be grouped with the referents of masculine gender (e.g. Amharic), or less commonly with the referents of feminine gender (e.g. Warekena), or split over the masculine and feminine genders in an arbitrary way or according to some semantically based principle (e.g. Garifuna).Gender oppositions in personal pronouns are characteristic of the third rather than the first or second person. This is suggested by Greenberg (1963: 96) Universal 44: “If a language has gender distinctions in the first person, it always has gender distinctions in the second or third person or in both”. Moreover, gender is seen as being typical of singular rather than non-singular personal pronouns. This, in turn, is expressed in Greenberg’s Universal 45: “If there are any gender distinctions in the plural of the pronoun, there are some gender distinctions in the singular also”. There are some exceptions to universals 44 and 45 involving independent person pronouns, but not many (cf. especially Plank and Schellinger 1997). 
The Prohibitive,,, This map shows the grammaticalization of a prohibition addressed to a single addressee. The category will be called the “second singular prohibitive”. Four values will be distinguished.
Situational Possibility,,, The map gives some indication about the kind of strategy used to express situational possibility in positive main clauses. Three types of languages are distinguished. The definitions make reference to three marking strategies: affixes on verbs, verbal constructions, and other constructions, ordered in terms of increasing cross-linguistic frequency. The first type on the map comprises languages that use the least frequent strategy, whether or not they also use the more frequent ones. Languages of the second type use the medium frequency (but not the low frequency) strategy, whether or not they also use the most frequent ones. Languages of the third type use only the most frequent strategy.
Position of Case Affixes,,, This map shows the position of case affixes on nouns, especially whether they are prefixes, as in the example in (1a) from Krongo (Kadugli; Sudan), or suffixes, as in (1b) from Tsova-Tush (Nakh-Daghestanian; Georgia).
Order of Subject and Verb,,, This map shows the dominant order of lexical (or nonpronominal) subject and verb. The primary types are languages which are SV (in which the subject precedes the verb), a type represented by English and by Turkish, as illustrated in (1a), and languages which are VS (in which the subject follows the verb), exemplified by Welsh, as illustrated in (1b).
Ordinal Numerals,,, This article surveys the global distribution of morphological patterns that connect ordinal numerals with cardinal numerals. We associate these two classes of numerals with different functional domains: By cardinal numerals, we understand the set of numerals used in attributive quantification of nouns (e.g. 'four days'). Ordinal numerals typically identify the position a given member of a set occupies relative to other members of the same set (e.g. 'the fourth day'). The main functions of ordinal numerals thus comprise the identification of ranks within a hierarchy and the identification of the temporal order in a sequence of events or the like. For more information on numerals, see Hurford (1975, 1987).We look at the formal relationship that obtains between cardinal numerals and their ordinal counterparts, i.e. we study morphological and syntactic (periphrastic) ways of deriving ordinals from cardinals. However, we exclude non-morphological marking by word order (cf. §2.2). Furthermore, we restrict our investigation to the first decade (i.e. to the values 1 through 10), because in many languages numeral systems do not go beyond ten, or the use of ordinal numerals is optional with higher numerical values. For the sake of brevity, our examples below list numerals up to value 5. The derivational dependence of ordinal numerals on cardinal numerals is the cover term for regular morphological derivation according to the synchronically valid rules of a given language, and also for all those cases where the morphological relation is of a purely historical nature, so that the word-form of the ordinal numeral reflects obsolete derivational rules of an earlier stage of the same language. Otherwise we consider ordinal numerals derivationally independent of their cardinal counterparts, or in other words, suppletive.
Nominal and Locational Predication,,, This map shows the possible relationships between the encoding of nominal and locational predicates. In particular, the map shows for each language whether nominal predications (such as John is a tailor) and locational predications (such as John is in Paris) can or cannot be encoded by the same strategy. In the terminology of Stassen (1997), a language is called a share-language if the encoding strategy for locational predications is (or can be) used for nominal predications, and a split-language if the encoding strategies for the two constructions must be different.
Reciprocal Constructions,,, Map 106A displays different ways in which languages encode reciprocal situations, i.e. situations like ‘They love each other’. The reciprocal situation comprises at least two simple situations (e.g., She loves him and He loves her), so one way to encode such a situation is to combine expressions for two simple situations, as seen in (1) from Cantonese:(1) Cantonese (Matthews and Yip 1994: 87)Ngóhbéi-minkéuihkéuihbéi-minngóh.Igive-facehimhegive-faceme‘He and I respect each other.’Apparently, this strategy of encoding reciprocated situations is possible in all languages, although the extent to which such a pattern is conventionalized in grammar and common in actual discourse differs from language to language. However, most languages also have simple or complex reciprocal markers (verbal affixes, pronouns, particles, adverbs, etc.), which, if combined with a verb within one clause, signal that the clause describes a reciprocal situation and not just the situation denoted by this verb, without repeating the verb for each simple situation. For example, English has two pronominal reciprocal markers, each other and one another; and in Kolyma Yukaghir (eastern Siberia), there is one reciprocal marker which is prefixed to the verb stem:
Expression of Pronominal Subjects,,, Across languages, we can distinguish two types of simple sentences differing in the nature of their subjects. One sort of simple sentence involves a nominal subject, a subject consisting of a noun, plus possibly some modifiers. The second sort of simple sentence involves a pronominal subject, where there is no nominal subject and where the subject is expressed at most by a morpheme or morphemes coding semantic or grammatical features of the subject, such as person, number, or gender. Thus, the English example in (1a) is a simple sentence with a nominal subject, while (1b) is a simple sentence with a pronominal subject.
Question Particles in Sign Languages,,, For the purpose of this chapter, question particles are defined as signs whose main function is to indicate that an utterance is a question. Question particles are distinct from tag questions in that the latter involve an intervening intonational break, with only the tag marked by an interrogative facial expression (example 1). They are also distinct from question introducers and pragmatic question markers. The latter mainly have a pragmatic function, carrying a more specific meaning such as expressing the speaker’s attitude towards the content of the utterance, and they may also be prosodically detached from the rest of the utterance (example 2).
Reason Clauses,,, This chapter examines the form of the verb in reason clauses. Examples (1) - (3) provide instances of reason clauses in English (throughout the chapter, reason clauses will be enclosed in square brackets in the examples):(1)I couldn't go to Paris last week [because all the trains were booked out].(2)[Since it will be raining soon], it's better not to go out.(3)[Being so busy], I couldn't do anything else.As was done for purpose clauses and ‘when’ clauses (Chapters 125 and 126), reason clauses are defined in functional, rather than morphosyntactic, terms. A reason construction is regarded as one encoding a causal relation between two events, such that one of the two (the event coded by the reason clause, or the dependent event) represents the reason for the other event (the main event) to take place.
Syllable Structure,,, The size of the sets of consonants and vowels which form the segment inventories of languages have been discussed in Chapters 1 and 2. In addition to the number of segments that languages use, it is also important to consider the ways that the segments are allowed to combine with each other in making longer structures, such as words and syllables. Some languages allow very free combination of segments, while in others the combinations are strongly restricted. In this chapter the complexity of sequencing of segments within syllables will be discussed as a means of examining one important aspect of how the combination of individual sounds is governed across the sampled set of languages.The syllable is a well-recognized unit in linguistic analysis which explains quite well the number of rhythmic units that will be perceived in a word or longer utterance. This number is usually equal to the number of vowels in the utterance. Although it is usually easy to get agreement on the number of syllables present in a word, intuitions sometimes differ over where the boundaries between one syllable and another should be placed. Despite such hesitation, the syllable has proven to be a very useful concept in discussing the general rules for distribution of sounds in languages. Where listeners differ in syllabifying particular words, it is generally the case that both possible syllabifications can be shown to be permitted ones since unambiguous cases of each type can be found. For example, an English word such as pastry might be syllabified by different speakers as past.ry or as pas.try (where the dot represents a division between syllables). Since both paste and tree are perfectly acceptable monosyllabic words of English, either division will agree with a broader rule concerning possible syllables of English. The broadest rules of this kind for any given language describe what is called the canonical syllable pattern of the language. This is the pattern which essentially characterizes how many consonants may occur before the vowel in a syllable, and how many after the vowel.
Utterance Complement Clauses,,, This chapter investigates the form of the verb in utterance complements, i.e. complement clauses introduced by utterance predicates such as ‘say’ or ‘tell’ (Noonan 1985: 110-113). Examples (1) - (2) provide instances of utterance complements in English (throughout the chapter, utterance complements will be enclosed in square brackets in the examples):(1)John said [that she came].(2)John says [he will not do the job].
Numeral Bases,,, This map is concerned with one aspect of the mathematical structure of linguistic expressions for numerals, namely the arithmetic base that is used in constructing numeral expressions. By the “base” of a numeral system we mean the value n  such that numeral expressions are constructed according to the pattern ... xn + y, i.e. some numeral x  multiplied by the base plus some other numeral. (The order of elements is irrelevant, as are the particular conventions used in individual languages to indicate multiplication and addition.) A simple example is provided by Mandarin, with base 10, in which the numeral 26 is expressed as in (1).
Imperative-Hortative Systems,,, Imperatives and hortatives both have to do with the expression of a wish of the speaker about a future state of affairs. In this respect they are like optatives (see Chapter 73), but in contrast to optatives, they convey an appeal to the addressee(s) to help make the future state of affairs true. In case the person in control of the desired state of affairs is the addressee or addressees, then we speak of an imperative. In any other case, we speak of a hortative. Consider the examples from English:
Consonant-Vowel Ratio,,, In previous chapters the size of the consonant inventory (Chapter 1) and the number of distinct vowel qualities (Chapter 2) have been discussed separately. In this chapter the ratio between these two properties of the sound systems of languages around the world will be considered. This is one way in which the complexity of different aspects of the systems can be evaluated. In Chapter 2 it was noted that there is no overall correlation between consonant inventory size and the number of vowel qualities. By looking at the two aspects jointly a more subtle picture of their interaction can be obtained.The ratio is calculated simply by dividing the number of consonants (C) by the number of vowel qualities (VQ) and will be referred to as the C/VQ ratio. The resulting numbers range from a low of only a little over 1 to a high of 29. The lowest value among the 563 languages for which it has been calculated is represented by Andoke (isolate; Colombia), which has 10 consonants and 9 vowel qualities. The highest number is represented by Abkhaz (Northwest Caucasian; Georgia), which is analyzed as having 58 consonants but only 2 vowel qualities. The ratio thus ranges between 1.11 and 29, but the more common values are nearer the lower end of the range: the mean is 4.25 and the median 3.5. The languages were grouped into five categories based on dividing the range into convenient steps below, near to, and above the median so as to create a histogram with approximately a normal distribution. Languages with a ratio equal to or below 2.0 were classed as having a “low” C/VQ ratio. Those with a ratio above 2.0 but below 2.75 were classed as “moderately low”. Those with a ratio of 2.75 or higher but less than 4.5 were classed as “average”, those with values of 4.5 or higher but less than 6.5 as “moderately high” and those with values above 6.5 as “high”. Only 10 languages have ratios of 12 or higher.
Third Person Pronouns and Demonstratives,,, In the case of 52 of these 125 languages, the affinity derives either from the fact that any of the demonstratives can be used as third person pronouns, or from the fact that third person pronouns and demonstratives share the same stem. In Basque, for example, hau ‘proximal’, hori ‘medial’ and hura ‘distal’ are third person pronouns that also function as demonstrative pronouns (Saltarelli et al. 1988: 213). 33 languages (out of the 52) have demonstratives any one of which can be used as a third person pronoun.In the case of four languages, there is a distinct third person pronoun, but the demonstratives can also function as third person pronouns. In Yukulta (Tangkic; Queensland, Australia), for example, ṇiya is the third person pronoun, but the demonstratives, ṭanta ‘this one’ and ṭant̪inta ‘that one’, can also function as third person pronouns (Keen 1983: 213).
Coding of Evidentiality,,, This chapter discusses the morphological coding of evidentiality, which marks the source of information the speaker has for his or her statement. This chapter complements Chapter 77, which deals with the semantic distinctions of evidentiality. As was the case in the previous chapter, only grammaticalized evidentials are included here.It turns out that evidentiality is marked across languages in a wide variety of ways. The following morphological means for encoding evidentiality are represented on the map:
Vowel Quality Inventories,,, This chapter discusses the number of vowel contrasts in the inventory of sounds in languages. It complements Chapter 1 on consonant inventories, although in this chapter the number of elements concerned is counted in a slightly different way. Vowels are the kinds of sounds that typically occur as the essential centers of syllables; in many languages the shortest possible word consists of just one vowel, as in the French word eau ‘water’, pronounced as the single vowel sound /o/. As this example shows, an established spelling system often involves a very indirect connection between the letters used and the vowel sounds of the language. The set of vowels used must therefore be established in the same kind of way as was discussed for consonants, in this case by comparing sets of words in which only the vowel sound differs. The English words seat, sit, sate, set, sat, sot, soot, suit show that English has at least 8 different vowel sounds. By considering further sets of words with other consonants, the full set of English vowels can be established (which will vary depending on the variety of English being considered).
Politeness Distinctions in Pronouns,,, Map 45A is concerned with politeness distinctions in personal pronouns, and more specifically second person pronouns. This phenomenon has been particularly well-studied in European languages. In German, for instance, there is a threefold distinction between a second person singular du  'you.sg.familiar', a second plural ihr  'you.pl.familiar', and a second person polite Sie  'you.honorific', which does not distinguish number. The polite pronoun Sie  is the default form of address among German adults who are not in a close social relation to each other. If they are relatives, married, close friends, professional colleagues, or university students, they are very likely to use the familiar du  to address each other. The usage of du  and Sie  is symmetrical (the one who gives Sie  (or du) will also receive it), with one exception: Adults address children and adolescents with du, but receive Sie.
Comitatives and Instrumentals,,, The present chapter provides an overview of the relations that hold between comitatives and instrumentals in the languages of the world. Comitative  and instrumental  are labels for grammaticalized semantic relations between participants of an event. For the purposes of coding such relations, a wide variety of relator morphemes is used, such as case affixes and adpositions. For convenience, all of the relevant relators are glossed by with in the examples below. For the present purpose, we have looked only at the most grammaticalized overt morphological expressions. Stylistic and other variation has been discounted for obvious reasons. Moreover, we restrict this presentation to prototypical instances of comitatives and instrumentals.Prototypically, a comitative relator morpheme is employed to encode accompaniment. An example is the Inga (Quechuan; Colombia) suffix -hua(n)  in (1a), where the third-person plural subject is the accompanee and alcalde  ‘mayor’ is the companion. An instrumental relator morpheme normally marks a noun phrase as the instrument used by an agent in a given situation to carry out the action designated by the lexical verb. An example is (1b), where the same Inga case suffix connects the third-person plural agent with the instrument caspi  ‘stick’ used to carry out the action of measuring depths.
The Optative,,, In this chapter, the term optative will refer to an inflected verb form dedicated to the expression of the wish of the speaker. An example comes from Bagvalal (Nakh-Daghestanian; eastern Caucasus):(1) Bagvalal (Dobrušina 2001: 328-329)Denhanč’u-bb-as-inā-Xb-is-a-nā,dēw-ič’a-be-la!1sg.erglying-nn-tell-impf-convn-find-pot-cond1sgm-die-imp-opt‘Would that I died if I’m lying!’This usage of the label optative is rather uncontroversial (Bybee et al. 1994: 179, Chung and Timberlake 1985: 247, Sadock and Zwicky 1985: 164), but other terms are also found in descriptive grammars. The speaker’s wish can be expressed by different grammatical means across languages, for instance, by the use of modal verbs, such as English may  in (2), or by a Russian elliptical conditional in (3):
Indefinite Articles,,, This map shows properties of indefinite articles. A morpheme is considered here to be an indefinite article if it accompanies a noun and signals that the noun phrase is pragmatically indefinite in the sense that it denotes something not known to the hearer, like the English word a  in a dog. This includes the use of the numeral for ‘one’ as an indefinite article and affixes on nouns signalling indefiniteness.
